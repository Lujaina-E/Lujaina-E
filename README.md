### Hey! âš¡

My name is Lujaina. I'm an incoming Engineering student at the University of Calgary. I'm looking to expand my skillset, specifically pertaining to the human/tech interface and the machine learning that comes with it. I'm a big believer in creating good things for the world and for others to enjoy, and while I'm not the biggest fan of software development myself, I like the feeling of playing mastermind. Whether you're poking around my Github to see what I'm working on or you want to know whether I'm really as good as I act, I hope you find what you're looking for, and free to shoot me a message using the links below:)
