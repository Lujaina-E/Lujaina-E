### Hey! âš¡

My name is Lujaina. I'm a software engineering student at the University of Calgary. I'm looking to expand my skillset, specifically pertaining to the human/tech interface and the machine learning that comes with it. I'm a big believer in creating good things for the world and for others to enjoy, and while I'm not the biggest fan of software development myself, I like the feeling of playing mastermind. I hope you find what you're looking for on my Github, and free to shoot me a message using the links below:)

### Currently Figuring out...

- Deployment via Heroku
- ML side projects
