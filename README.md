### Hey!âœ¨

My name is Lujaina. I'm an incoming Engineering student at the University of Calgary. I'm a big believer in creating good things for the world and for others to enjoy, and while I'm not the biggest fan of software development myself, I like the feeling of playing mastermind. Whether you're poking around my Github to see what I'm working on or you want to know whether I'm really as good as I seem, I hope you find what you're looking for, and  free to reach out to me:)
